            <em>“Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from 
            it.” </em>

                </p>
                <p>At ICGC-Empowerment Temple, we recognize that the future of our 
            church lies with our children. The children’s ministry goal is to help our children grow in 
            their relationship with Jesus Christ. Our teachers use a holistic and creative approach to 
            instruct our children and to make the stories of the Bible come alive during our Sunday 
            school sessions. The children’s ministry also sponsors year-round activities to ensure 
            connectivity with the remainder of the church. Some of the activities include: theatrical 
            performances, readings, singing events, etc…</p>

                <p>
                    <em>“You also must help us by prayer, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many”</em><b> (2 Corinthians 1:11)</b>.
                    At ICGC-Empowerment Temple, RI, we believe in the power of prayer; and that is why we view the intercessory ministry as the frontline army of our church. Tasked with the mandate of standing in the gap for others, these “soldiers” use their God-given gifts to intercede repeatedly and engage in spiritual warfare to decommission the plots of the enemy against the church and its membership.
